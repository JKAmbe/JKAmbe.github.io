                            with anything from C++, Java, phyton, and C#. Game engine wise I've experimented with most
                            of the easily available ones like Unity, Unreal, godot. I even dabble with stuff like vr,
                            javascript, webXR!
                            Other than coding, as a student in Interaction design, I'm quite versed in UX and UI design,
                            and as an (aspiring) game developer, I can do 3d modelling, sounds, and animations!

                                The pitch was to made a starfox 64 style of 2 axis shoot'em'up' but with multiple playable character and our own twist of style.
                                <br><br>
                                I played multiple role during the game's production. I managed tickets, programmed a LOT, and I even get to draw and model my own characters.
                                A lot happened as always, getting burned out, personal issues, technical problems but we got there in the end and we're all VERY proud with how it turned out.

                                The pitch for this one is to make gundam style funnels in Unreal Engine and turn it into a multiplayer game.
                                Bear in mind that this is the first time me and my teammate touched Unreal engine. This one is yet another collaborative work, this time with only one other student with me.
                                We're allowed to do pretty much anything, both of us love gundams, and well we decided to go a bit overboard.

                                For this project, we have to work around a no violent restriction and follow a randomized theme.
                                The pitch that we end up with was a point and click style puzzle game set in a magical world where you work as the botanist.

                                We each got to do our own level, mines are the final and the tutorial. I got to do a LOT of the programming, and modelling for this one.
                                I was the most  experienced member in the group, and I think it went quite well for my first real game
