                                After a short Internship, I took a break and work on a small micro game for a 2 day jam hosted by UTS. This one isn't a full fledged game or anything -it was made in 2 days- but I have a lot of fun working on it. My goal for this one besides winning the game jam is to try out Unreal's
                                Mixed Reality infrastructure, and by the end I got both hand tracking and passthrough working (with hand occlusion), so I'd say mission accomplish. Oh and also I post it on

                                A collaboration between me and 3 other game design students during my last semester at UTS, showcased during the 2023 UTS tech fest.
                                The pitch was to make a starfox 64 style 2 axis shoot'em'up' but with multiple playable character and our own twist of style.
                                <br><br>
                                I played multiple role during the game's production. I managed tickets, programmed a LOT, and I even get to draw and model my own characters.
                                A lot happened as always; getting burned out, personal issues, technical problems but we got there in the end and we're all VERY proud with how it turned out.

                                The pitch for this one is to make gundam style funnels in Unreal Engine and turn it into a multiplayer game.
                                Bear in mind that this is the first time me and my teammate touched Unreal engine. This one is yet another collaborative work, this time with only one other student with me.
                                We're allowed to do pretty much anything, both of us love gundams, and well we decided to go a bit overboard.

                                For this project, we have to work around a no violent restriction and follow a randomized theme.
                                The pitch that we end up with was a point and click style puzzle game set in a magical world where you work as the botanist.

                                We each got to do our own level, mines are the final and the tutorial. I got to do a LOT of the programming, and modelling for this one.
                                I was the most  experienced member in the group, and I think it went quite well for my first real game
